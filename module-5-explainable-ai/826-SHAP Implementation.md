Also known as the "Adult" dataset.

This is a binary classification problem.

Let's implement SHAP and see how we can derive some interesting inferences through beautiful visualizations.

**PS. Some visualizations are omitted on web so it's better to open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.**
