### What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction.

A Decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where:

* each internal node denotes a test on an attribute/feature,
* each branch represents an outcome of the test, and
* each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label (Yes and No in this case).

### Decision Trees

Regression tree analysis is used when the predicted outcome can be considered a real number (e.g., the price of a house or a patient's length of stay in a hospital).

### CART

You might encounter the term 'CART' while building ML models. It's nothing new but the same old Decision Tree since it can be used for both Classification and Regression.

**CART = Classification and Regression Trees,** an umbrella term for:

**Classification Trees:** where the target variable is categorical, the tree is used to identify the "class" within which a target variable would likely fall into.

**Regression Trees:** where the target variable is continuous, and the tree is used to predict its value.
