Classification tree methods (i.e., decision tree methods) are recommended when the task contains classifications or predictions of outcomes, and the goal is to generate rules that can be easily explained and translated into SQL or a natural query language.

A Classification tree labels, records, and assigns variables to discrete classes. A Classification tree can also provide confidence that the classification is correct.

## CART

You might encounter the term 'CART' while building ML models. It's nothing new but the same old Decision Tree.

CART = Classification and Regression Trees, an umbrella term for:

**Classification Trees**: The target variable is categorical, and the tree is used to identify the "class" within which a target variable would likely fall.

**Regression Trees**: The target variable is continuous, and a tree is used to predict its value.
